To Contribute...

1. Create a personal fork of this repo on your Github.

2. Clone the fork on your local machine (pc) .
   using "git clone url of the repo."
   Once you have cloned your remote on Github is called origin.

3. On your local machine (pc) inside the cloned project, add the origin repository as a remote called upstream.
   i.e git remote add upstream url of the repo.

4. Create a new branch to work on. Branch from the master branch. It is recommended that you make a new branch for every new feature you work on and work from there.
   You can use "git checkout -b name of new brach" shorthand to create a new brach and switch to it .

5. Push your branch to your fork Github, i.e the remote origin.

6. From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's master branch.

7. Be sure to always pull upstream changes into your local repository to keep updates of the main repo.

"git pull upstream branch_name" which is the main branch (master).

These are the set of instructions from Mark.

Try and always:

8. Comment your codes properly.

9. Follow the code style of the project including indentation.
